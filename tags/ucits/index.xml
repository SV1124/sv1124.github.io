      <description>AIFMs, UCITS managers and asset managers/investment advisors are allowed to delegate certain functions under the AIFMD and its implementing laws.*1 The Belgian regulator FSMA has recently issued detailed guidelines on outsourcing, aimed specifically at AIFMs, UCITS and asset managers/investment advisors (hereafter referred to as ‘Companies’*2) - amidst a more general increased scrutiny vis-à-vis outsourcing arrangements by regulated entities.&#xA;Although not revolutionary, the guidelines provide significant extra body to applicable outsourcing requirements.</description>

      <description>Over summer, ESMA updated its Q&amp;amp;A on the AIFM Directive (EU Directive 2011/61/EU) with some new questions (and more importantly, answers) - including with respect to pre-marketing in a context of sub-threshold managers (AIFMs).&#xA;Summary: ESMA confirmed that sub-threshold managers are not subject to the obligation to notify pre-marketing (unless otherwise required by national rules). The flip-side is of course that national rules will apply and should be considered carefully if a sub-threshold manager intends to (pre-)market in a EU jurisdiction.</description>

      <description>Right before Christmas, ESMA released its final report on draft technical standards on the notifications for cross-border marketing and cross-border management of AIFS and UCITS, after processing the responses it received on its consultation in this respect that closed on 9 September 2022.&#xA;The main changes made to the original standards are the following:&#xA;a requirement to provide a LEI was introduced; the information to be provided on delegation arrangements was toned down; and the information to be provided on marketing strategy was toned down.</description>
