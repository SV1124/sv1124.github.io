      <description>Since last spring, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a lawyer: I switched sides and currently work as a judge at the Dutch speaking enterprise court of Brussels.&#xA;Nevertheless, this week I got a nice suprise. [IFLR1000]here, one of the main &amp;rsquo;lawyer rankings&amp;rsquo;, ranked me as a &amp;lsquo;Rising Star&amp;rsquo; for the work I used to do as a financial services regulatory lawyer.&#xA;However relative (being very careful with my words here) these rankings are, actually being ranked is an awesome feeling - prompting nothing but gratefulness: towards my former clients, colleagues and team.</description>
