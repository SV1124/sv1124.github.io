      <description>Since last spring, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a lawyer: I switched sides and currently work as a judge at the Dutch speaking enterprise court of Brussels.&#xA;Nevertheless, this week I got a nice suprise. [IFLR1000]here, one of the main &amp;rsquo;lawyer rankings&amp;rsquo;, ranked me as a &amp;lsquo;Rising Star&amp;rsquo; for the work I used to do as a financial services regulatory lawyer.&#xA;However relative (being very careful with my words here) these rankings are, actually being ranked is an awesome feeling - prompting nothing but gratefulness: towards my former clients, colleagues and team.</description>

      <title>Footnotes and legal academics</title>

      <description>Over the past couple of years working as a practioner, I started craving for a more academic experience. Hence, I got back to my research roots and started re-developing my academic writing (which I had basically left off immediately after finishing university).&#xA;Contrary to what was the case when I was still at university, I am now married - to someone who studied hard sciences (chemistry), no less. When she first reviewed one of my articles, she laughed out loud because of the incredible amount of footnotes and references.</description>

      <title>Hospitaalcongregaties: een bijzonder beestje</title>

      <description>Ik verwees eerder op deze blog al naar mijn bijzondere interesse in het kloosterleven en alles wat errond hangt.&#xA;Deze interesse mocht ik recent nog eens botvieren in een annotatie bij een interessant arrest van de Raad van State (Rvs. 29 november 2023) over een hospitaalcongregatie - een ietwat vergeten rechtsvorm.&#xA;De noot behandelt onder meer de geschiedenis en het statuut van de hospitaalcongregatie, de (niet-)toepassing van het WVV op rechtsvormen die niet door het WVV geregeld worden, nietigheid van besluitvorming bij dergelijke rechtsvormen en het eigendomsrecht van de zusters.</description>

      <description>Sinds mijn twaalfde heb ik een bijzondere fascinatie voor het monastieke leven. De voorbije maanden linkte ik die met mijn interesse voor geschiedenis, kerkelijk recht en rechtspersonenrecht, en schreef ik een artikel over governance in Benedictijnse abdijen en &amp;lsquo;instituten van gewijd leven&amp;rsquo;, met een bijzondere focus op de positie van de abt in instituten en abdijen onder de regel van Benedictus.&#xA;Ik neem er het standpunt in dat we ons niet moeten blindstaren op de autoritaire positie van de abt binnen zijn abdij (of overste binnen zijn instituut).</description>

      <description>Last month I published an article in a peer reviewed journal: &amp;quot;All over the place: ETS emission allowances in EU financial regulaton&amp;quot;,TRV-RPS 2024/1, 5-28.&#xA;In the article, I provide a general overview of rules and obligations applicable to market participants that wish to hold or trade allowances - taking into account the recent updates of the Emissions Trading System.&#xA;This overview demonstrates that the common thread of allowances-specific rules is a plethora of information and reporting requirements.</description>

      <title>A brief FAQ on AIFMD II</title>
      <link>https://SV1124.github.io/posts/a-brief-faq-on-aifmd-ii/</link>

      <description>The final texts of AIFMD II were (finally) made available on the website of the council last autumn. Although not yet published in the official gazette, these final texts settle some points raised earlier.1 Full reviews of the final texts (and earlier) iterations are available elsewhere2 and many law firms have already issued newsletters providing overviews of the changes.&#xA;However, I found it useful to mold a short 5-question FAQ of some questions that came up most often in the run-up to AIFMD II.</description>

      <title>Why I switched to Firefox (and maybe you should too)</title>

      <guid>https://SV1124.github.io/posts/why-i-switched-to-firefox/</guid>
      <description>A short while ago, I had a minor issue with my computer. I called our IT service provider, who quickly came to my assistance. He wanted to download something and went out looking for Chrome when he saw the Firefox logo on my taskbar. &amp;ldquo;Oh, you are still using that?&amp;rdquo;. As if I still had Netscape or Internet Explorer - or something.&#xA;His reaction is emblematic. Together with the sharp increase of the use of Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers with it), the use of Firefox has known a steady decline since its top around 2010 (see statcount chart here).</description>

      <title>ESMA MiCA consultations on reverse solicitation and qualification of instruments: interesting reads</title>

      <description>The new ESMA consultations on reverse solicitation in the context of MiCA and the qualification of instruments as financial instruments vs. crypto assets are interesting reads, even if only because they basically give a read-up on the status of reverse enquiry and definition(s) of mifid financial instruments in general (in particular on the concept of &amp;rsquo;transferable securities&amp;rsquo;).&#xA;As indicated by people wiser than I am on LinkedIn, the core can be found in paragraph 8 of the consultation on qualification of instruments, i.</description>

      <description>Here we are, a brand new blog. Some old content, some new content planned. After a year of using LinkedIn for blogging, I have decided I want to take it one step further and bundle some more stuff on here.&#xA;This has various reasons:&#xA;I get to keep better control over where my content ends up - if LinkedIn changes its business model, that&amp;rsquo;s not on me.&#xA;I do believe that a fragmented internet with easily accessible and searchable content is what the internet should be.</description>

      <description>Websites usually do not have a &amp;lsquo;how it was built&amp;rsquo; page.&#xA;But for this one, I felt compelled to have one. I would not have been able to build this without freely available tools, software and guidance. I am convinced that when taking stuff from a community, one should also use best efforts to contribute. Let this be my humble contribution.&#xA;Hope it may provide some inspiration or help to other people considering building their own blog or webpage and looking past the well-trodden CMS, Wix&amp;rsquo;es or Squarespaces of this world.</description>

      <title>New FSMA outsourcing guidelines for AIFMs, UCITS and asset managers/investment advisors - 10 key take-aways and 2 bis rounds</title>

      <description>AIFMs, UCITS managers and asset managers/investment advisors are allowed to delegate certain functions under the AIFMD and its implementing laws.*1 The Belgian regulator FSMA has recently issued detailed guidelines on outsourcing, aimed specifically at AIFMs, UCITS and asset managers/investment advisors (hereafter referred to as ‘Companies’*2) - amidst a more general increased scrutiny vis-à-vis outsourcing arrangements by regulated entities.&#xA;Although not revolutionary, the guidelines provide significant extra body to applicable outsourcing requirements.</description>

      <title>Sub-threshold AIFs: marketing and pre-marketing</title>

      <description>Over summer, ESMA updated its Q&amp;amp;A on the AIFM Directive (EU Directive 2011/61/EU) with some new questions (and more importantly, answers) - including with respect to pre-marketing in a context of sub-threshold managers (AIFMs).&#xA;Summary: ESMA confirmed that sub-threshold managers are not subject to the obligation to notify pre-marketing (unless otherwise required by national rules). The flip-side is of course that national rules will apply and should be considered carefully if a sub-threshold manager intends to (pre-)market in a EU jurisdiction.</description>

      <title>The new EC Retail Investment Package and its amendments to the AIFMD: focus on (un)due costs</title>

      <description>It is nowhere near as sexy as the recently voted MiCA package, or as crucial for the future of our planet as the CSDDD, but the European Commission last week also came up with a ‘Retail Investment Package’ (the &amp;ldquo;Package&amp;rdquo;) that is supposed to ‘empower retail investors’ and ‘make the EU an even safer place for people to invest their savings in the long term’ - which obviously are noble causes as well.</description>

      <title>New regulation on marketing virtual currencies to Belgian consumers</title>

      <description>Crypto-winter does not only seem to be consolidation time for companies involved. It also is for legislators. With MiCA(R) on its way, a new Belgian regulation on marketing virtual currencies to Belgian consumers was published in the Belgian Official Gazette this morning.[1]&#xA;The regulation is based on three elements:&#xA;compliance with minimum rules to ensure that the information in the advertisement is correct and not misleading; the mandatory inclusion of specific warnings in the advertisement; and the obligation to notify the FSMA in advance of mass campaigns.</description>

      <title>New ESMA Q&amp;A on sub-threshold AIFMS doesn&#39;t really clarify much.</title>

      <description>Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) the sub-threshold regime is largely left to national authorities. This regime applies to AIFMs that manage portfolios of AIFs whose assets under management fall below certain thresholds - essentially carving them out from AIFMD. Given the large stakes (i.e. falling under AIFMD or not), the relevant thresholds (and in particular their calculation) are highly scrutinized in practice.&#xA;This makes it the more interesting that ESMA today updated its Q&amp;amp;A on the AIFMD with a question on the calculation of these thresholds, and in particular the interpretation of “substantive direct or indirect holding” in Article 3(2) of the AIFMD.</description>

      <description>On 24 January 2023, the EP’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) approved its amended draft (compromise) text of the amendments to the AIFMD and UCITSD (with 54 votes against 3, only the left-radical ‘The Left’ fraction voted against). The EP’s report (the &amp;ldquo;Final Report&amp;rdquo;) was published on 2 February 2023 and is available here.&#xA;The Final Report follows a November 2021 proposal of the EC, an initial May 2022 draft report of the EP ECON Committee (the “May Draft”) and a June 2022 ‘compromise text’ of the Council.</description>

      <description>In an assessment of the Brexit relocation processes (available on the website of ESMA), ESMA last December made some interesting observations on how different national authorities handle firms&amp;rsquo; relocation to the EU in the context of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. The report focused on MiFID II investment firms, trading firm and fund managers.&#xA;General findings # The key findings of the report with respect to all three categories were the following:</description>

      <description>Right before Christmas, ESMA released its final report on draft technical standards on the notifications for cross-border marketing and cross-border management of AIFS and UCITS, after processing the responses it received on its consultation in this respect that closed on 9 September 2022.&#xA;The main changes made to the original standards are the following:&#xA;a requirement to provide a LEI was introduced; the information to be provided on delegation arrangements was toned down; and the information to be provided on marketing strategy was toned down.</description>

      <description>On the very same day as Belgian crypto exchange Bit4You cancelled its SPAC IPO, and only shortly after the New York Times declared ‘game over’ on SPACs, ESMA has addressed whether managers of SPACS are subject to the AIFMD in an update of its AIFMD Q&amp;amp;A .&#xA;This question is relevant, as being subject to AIFMD would trigger a whole set of regulatory rules, including a license requirement, liquidity rules etc.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, the ESMA provided its perspective on the collapse of FTX (through the opening statement of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament available here). For sure, this is is not the latest we have heard from EU and other regulators on crypto (see ao here), nor the most elaborate discussion, but it does definitely give some pointers on how the EU and its member states might approach crypto winter and the termoil that goes with it.</description>
