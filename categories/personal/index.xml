      <description>Since last spring, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a lawyer: I switched sides and currently work as a judge at the Dutch speaking enterprise court of Brussels.&#xA;Nevertheless, this week I got a nice suprise. [IFLR1000]here, one of the main &amp;rsquo;lawyer rankings&amp;rsquo;, ranked me as a &amp;lsquo;Rising Star&amp;rsquo; for the work I used to do as a financial services regulatory lawyer.&#xA;However relative (being very careful with my words here) these rankings are, actually being ranked is an awesome feeling - prompting nothing but gratefulness: towards my former clients, colleagues and team.</description>

      <title>Footnotes and legal academics</title>

      <description>Over the past couple of years working as a practioner, I started craving for a more academic experience. Hence, I got back to my research roots and started re-developing my academic writing (which I had basically left off immediately after finishing university).&#xA;Contrary to what was the case when I was still at university, I am now married - to someone who studied hard sciences (chemistry), no less. When she first reviewed one of my articles, she laughed out loud because of the incredible amount of footnotes and references.</description>

      <title>Why I switched to Firefox (and maybe you should too)</title>
      <link>https://SV1124.github.io/posts/why-i-switched-to-firefox/</link>

      <description>A short while ago, I had a minor issue with my computer. I called our IT service provider, who quickly came to my assistance. He wanted to download something and went out looking for Chrome when he saw the Firefox logo on my taskbar. &amp;ldquo;Oh, you are still using that?&amp;rdquo;. As if I still had Netscape or Internet Explorer - or something.&#xA;His reaction is emblematic. Together with the sharp increase of the use of Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers with it), the use of Firefox has known a steady decline since its top around 2010 (see statcount chart here).</description>

      <description>Here we are, a brand new blog. Some old content, some new content planned. After a year of using LinkedIn for blogging, I have decided I want to take it one step further and bundle some more stuff on here.&#xA;This has various reasons:&#xA;I get to keep better control over where my content ends up - if LinkedIn changes its business model, that&amp;rsquo;s not on me.&#xA;I do believe that a fragmented internet with easily accessible and searchable content is what the internet should be.</description>

      <title>How this website was built</title>
      <link>https://SV1124.github.io/posts/how-this-website-was-built/</link>

      <description>Websites usually do not have a &amp;lsquo;how it was built&amp;rsquo; page.&#xA;But for this one, I felt compelled to have one. I would not have been able to build this without freely available tools, software and guidance. I am convinced that when taking stuff from a community, one should also use best efforts to contribute. Let this be my humble contribution.&#xA;Hope it may provide some inspiration or help to other people considering building their own blog or webpage and looking past the well-trodden CMS, Wix&amp;rsquo;es or Squarespaces of this world.</description>
